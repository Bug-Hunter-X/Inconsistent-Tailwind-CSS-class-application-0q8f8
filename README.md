# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates an issue where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to an HTML element.  The problem manifests intermittently, making it difficult to debug. The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` offers a potential solution.

## Problem

The provided code snippet aims to create a div with a gray background and padding using Tailwind CSS classes. However, these styles are not always applied correctly, resulting in unexpected rendering.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration and build process are correctly set up, and examining the parent element to ensure no conflicting styles exist.  Further investigation may be needed if the problem persists to rule out other potential causes.
